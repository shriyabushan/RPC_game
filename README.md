# Rock Paper Scissors Hand Gesture Game with YOLOv8✊✋✌️

Welcome to an AI-powered Rock Paper Scissors game! This project uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to recognize hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors — transforming your webcam or images into an interactive game.

---

##  Features

- Real-time detection of rock, paper, and scissors gestures
- YOLOv8-based hand gesture classification
- Python game logic to determine winners
- Scripts to train, test, and analyze your own models
- Lightweight and easy to run on most systems

---
##  Dataset

Trained the YOLOv8 model on a custom rock-paper-scissors dataset:  
- [Rock Paper Scissors Dataset (Roboflow)](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-rock-paper-scissors/rock-paper-scissors-dataset)  
- Class labels: rock, paper, scissors  
- 2,500+ labeled images 

---
## How to Play

- Connect your webcam or test on images from test images/.
- Run the game:
python rps_game.py
- Follow on-screen instructions to show your hand gesture and play against the AI!
